###**B**###each **E**nvironment for the **A**nalyti**c**s of **H**uman **Gaze** (BEACH-Gaze) provides reuseable and extensible support to the broader scientific community interested in descriptive and predictive gaze analytics applied to a wide range of domains. 

# Abstract

The purpose of this codebase is to provide an eye gaze analysis tool that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the fatigue level of participants. The codebase is compatible with Gazepoint's GP3 Desktop and GP3HD V2 eyetrackers and uses the WEKA software collection for its data mining procedures.

# Setup

- You will need to setup an eyetracker from Gazepoint and a monitor that is up to 24". Follow the directions as listed by your Gazepoint eyetracker to setup your experiment enviroment. This codebase was developed using the GP3 Desktop and GP3HD V2 eyetrackers, other eyetrackers may not work correctly.
- You will need to have [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) support and the Java 21 JDK installed on your machine. Maven will automatically install and update the required dependencies.
- **Please note that the screen size is hard-coded into the main.java file.** If the screen size of the monitor that the experiment was conducted on differs from the size specified in the code, it is necessary to edit the code to reflect the correct screen size. Failure to do so may result in incorrect calculations.

# How To Use The Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git or your preferred version control system.
2. Ensure that you have all the required libraries installed and run the program
3. A prompt will appear asking you to select the gaze file you want the program to analyze 
4. After selecting the gaze file, the program will ask you to select the corresponding fixation file.
5. A prompt will then appear asking you to select the location where you would like all the output files to be saved.
6. The program will then ask you to input the name of the folder/participant.
7. Once the program finishes analyzing and outputting the initial data, it will ask whether or not you would like to generate schedules pr even-based windows of the gaze/fixation data.
    * If you select yes then the program will give you four different window options:
        - Tumbling Window: This option generates gaze data in a series of fixed, nonoverlapping windows.
        - Expanding Window: This option generates gaze data in a series of expanding windows that increases with every interval.
        - Hopping Window This option generates gaze data in a series of fixed and overlapping windows.
        - Event Window: This option generates a baseline file based on the first two minutes of the gaze data, and then compares it to the rest of the file. If the data exceeds the baseline value, it will be counted as an event, and the program will continue to search for the next event within a specified time period. If no event is found, the program will close at a specific period. If another event is found, the session window will continue searching.
8. Depending on the option you choose, the program will ask for different input. For the first three options, the program will ask you to select the window size and/or overlapping amount (both in terms of time in seconds).
9. If you choose the last option, Event Window, the program will ask you which gaze or fixation file you would like to analyze. The program will create a baseline file based on the first two minutes and then ask you to pick a baseline value and a value from the file you inputted to compare 
    to each other, as well as a maximum duration of an event.

# Limitations

1. Several sections of the codebase rely on the existence of data columns in the raw data files. To ensure that the program functions correctly, select all the possible columns when exporting data from the Gazepoint Analysis software.
2. The program will create a folder for the participant regardless of whether the program executes successfully.
3. If the names and location selected for the files match those of an existing file, the existing file will be automatically overwritten.
